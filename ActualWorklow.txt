This is essentially a REFACTORING Excercise.

High Level Worfklow:
====================
1. We need to apply a suite of Tests to the initial code, to give some coverage, and see where things will break before we refactor.
2. Once we have tests we can refactor, taking into account code smells, and SOLID principles.
3. We need to apply Triangulation when refactoring, creating new code (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
4. Test should use AAA framework (Arrange-Act-Assert)
5. Code checkins to have comments to show work flow, and highlight refactorings and code smells.
6. Follow "boyscout" principle.

I have decided to use BDD and TDD testing, using:
-SpecFlow (BDD)
-NUnit and RhinoMocks - (TDD)

Tests for gaining code coverage, will follow a Horizontal Slice, i.e. BDD => TDD for each test.
1.
First set of tests are unit and are really there to test the NUnit Framework and Test Runners etc, but more importantly they
make us aware that the access modifiers placed on the Program class (by default), do not allow the code to be tested from a different
test project
2.
The unit tests from above need splitting out as test scenarios should be in seperate files, so we will split to some simple Program tests
and then split and reuse one test method for testing the quality reduces each day.
As I can see that their will be some common setup, I will introduce a new abstract test class to give me an AAA framework, to
work within. The abstract class can be reused for different types of test. It can also be reused for the BDD testing.
I want an AAA (ArrangeActAssert) framework.
3.
Now we have access to the Program for testing, we can begin to introduce the Behavioural Tests.
These test are in a Given,That,Then syntax, and are SpecFlow Feature tests. They are Acceptance Tests and are great for giving test
coverage at a higher level. They cover the functionality of the application. So we will begin implementing each test, one at a time,
and adding unit tests after each scenario, in a horizontal slice.
Steps are used to build up the background code.
The scenarios are in the Acceptance Test project in a feature file (UpdateStockItems.feature), and are in the Features folder.
